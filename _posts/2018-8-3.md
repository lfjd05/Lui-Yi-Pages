My first Blog
==
Hi, I'm Lui Yi. A geek likes making anything fantastic. Welcome to my blog. I'm trying to learn how to use Github.
I appreciate the author in Jekyll gave me the excellent blog template.<br>

Several days latter, I'll transport some works in Wechat subscription.<br>
Here is my favourite work -- a Mobile telecontrol car.<br>
